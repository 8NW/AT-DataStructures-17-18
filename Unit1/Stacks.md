# Stacks

http://www.alcula.com/calculators/rpn/

Stacks are a data structure where elements are enqueued and dequeued in Last In First Out order. The data that a Stack keeps track of are it's size and a reference to the top node. 

Each node in a stack keeps track of it's data and a reference to the node beneath it. 

The main stack operations are Push-add a new node to the top of the stack, Pop-remove the top node of the stack and return it, and usually Peek- return the top node of the stack without deleting it from the stack.
